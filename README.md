# Coup-RL
This was my final year project, where I trained various models to play the card game Coup, using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). When evaluated against random these, models exceeded the current best. Overall, this project received 80/100. A more comprhensive description of my findings, and running the game will be added soon.

## Brief Running Instructions
